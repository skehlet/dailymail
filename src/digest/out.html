    <p>During the Covid-19 emergency, the U.S. developed a national hospitalization reporting system, which provided crucial visibility and facilitated action. However, this requirement is ending on April 30. Public comments on the importance of maintaining this system will be solicited starting May 2. Covid-19 levels in wastewater and hospitalizations are currently very low, though the virus continues to mutate with a new variant called FLiRT. Additionally, there are recommendations for those over 65 and at high risk to get their spring Covid-19 vaccine soon, as a fall vaccine will follow.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect is the sunsetting of the hospital reporting requirement, which was a critical tool during the pandemic and is now at risk of being discontinued. Another noteworthy point is the WHO&#x27;s recommendation of a JN.1 formula for the fall Covid-19 vaccine, highlighting the ongoing efforts to keep global vaccination strategies aligned.</p>
