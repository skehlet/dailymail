However, this requirement is ending on April 30. Public comments on the importance of maintaining this system will be solicited starting May 2. Covid-19 levels in wastewater and hospitalizations are currently very low, though the virus continues to mutate with a new variant called FLiRT. Additionally, there are recommendations for those over 65 and at high risk to get their spring Covid-19 vaccine soon, as a fall vaccine will follow.\\n\\nOne interesting aspect is the sunsetting of the hospital reporting requirement, which was a critical tool during the pandemic and is now at risk of being discontinued. Another noteworthy point is the WHO's recommendation of a JN.1 formula for the fall Covid-19 vaccine, highlighting the ongoing efforts to keep global vaccination strategies aligned.\"}"
