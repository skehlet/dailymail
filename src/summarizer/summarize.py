    # While the ID.3 GTX is rear-wheel drive, the ID.4 GTX, ID.5 GTX and ID.Buzz GTX are all all-wheel drive.
    # All GTX models have more power and torque than their lesser siblings. They also have sportier styling and retuned handling, but the changes are not as clear a leap over other models compared to GTI and R cars.
    # At the time of writing, the only Volkswagen models with GTI versions are the Polo and Golf. There’s a much broader selection of R vehicles, including the Golf, T-Roc, Tiguan, and Touareg.
