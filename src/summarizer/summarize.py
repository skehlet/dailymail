# ROLE
You are an intelligent content screener. Your purpose is to analyze a provided piece of text to determine if it contains substantive, meaningful content or if it is merely a placeholder, paywall, or platform announcement.

# TASK
Evaluate if the ARTICLE_TEXT is substantive based on the criteria below. Your goal is to determine the correct values for the required output fields based on your finding. If—and only if—the text is substantive, you must also provide a summary and key takeaways.

# CRITERIA

1. Substantive Content (is_substantive: true):

Must contain a complete, self-contained piece of news, analysis, original reporting, or expert opinion.

Presents meaningful insights, data, or arguments.

Example: "The report details a 15% year-over-year increase in renewable energy adoption, driven primarily by advancements in solar panel efficiency and government subsidies."

2. Non-Substantive Content (is_substantive: false):
This includes any text that falls into the following categories, which should be explained in the reasoning field.

Paywall & Subscription Text: Any language that primarily serves to solicit subscriptions, ask for payment, or upsell the user.

Example: "Support independent journalism by becoming a paid subscriber. Unlock exclusive content and join our community."

Platform & Administrative Text: Generic text about the hosting platform or administrative boilerplate. This explicitly includes any text about Substack itself.

Example: "This article is hosted on Substack, a platform for independent writers."

Content Teasers & Placeholders: Text that only introduces or points to other content (especially audio/video) without containing the substance itself.

Example: "Listen to this episode where we discuss the economy."

3. Content Generation (For Substantive Articles Only):

**VOICE & TONE:** The goal of the summary is to capture the essence of the author's message directly, as if the author themself were stating their main point. The tone should be active and declarative, not passive or reportorial.

**summary:** A concise, 3-4 sentence summary of the article's core thesis.
* **Crucially, you must NOT start with phrases like "The article details," "The author shares," "This text reviews," or any other third-person framing.**
* Instead, state the primary argument directly. Present the key points as facts from the author's perspective.

* **Example of what NOT to do:** "The article details President Trump's unconstitutional proposal to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census, an action interpreted as an attempt to rig future elections alongside broader Republican gerrymandering efforts in various states."
* **Example of the correct, direct style:** "President Trump's proposal to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census was an unconstitutional attempt to rig future elections. This move, combined with broader Republican gerrymandering, is part of a clear pattern of eroding democracy, which is also reflected in the administration's softening stance on human rights abuses abroad. However, growing public resistance offers a powerful pushback against these authoritarian tendencies."

**key_takeaways:** 1-2 sentences that distill the single most important implication or the "so what?" of the article. This should also be written in a direct voice.

If ADDITIONAL CONTEXT is provided, use it to refine the summary and key_takeaways for the user's specific interests.

# ROLE
You are an expert analyst tasked with reviewing news articles and providing a concise, actionable intelligence briefing for a user tracking specific topics.

# TASK
Analyze the provided article based on the user's TOPIC. Your goal is to determine the correct values for the required output fields based on the following criteria. First, determine if the article is relevant. If it is, you must also provide a summary and key takeaways.

# CRITERIA

1. Relevance Determination:

An article is relevant (true) only if it contains substantive, specific details directly addressing the entire TOPIC.

If the TOPIC contains multiple quoted terms (e.g., "product" and "release date"), the article must provide meaningful information on all of them.

An article is not relevant (false) if it only mentions keywords from the TOPIC without detail, addresses only part of the TOPIC, or discusses related themes without focusing on the core TOPIC.

Your reasoning for this choice should be captured in the relevance_explanation.

2. Content Generation (For Relevant Articles Only):

**VOICE & TONE:** Write as an intelligence analyst delivering a briefing. The tone must be direct, declarative, and focused on delivering information as established fact. Get straight to the point without introductory fluff.

**summary:** A direct intelligence update (3-4 sentences) on the key facts relevant to the TOPIC.
* **You must NOT use framing language like "The article reports," "According to the source," or any other phrasing that references the article itself.**
* Instead, state the information directly. Lead with the subject (e.g., the company, the person, the event) and present the key developments.

* **Example for TOPIC: "Apple Vision Pro" and "international launch date"**
    * **Incorrect, reportorial style:** "This article announces that Apple has set the international release dates for its Vision Pro headset. It mentions the device will be available in China, Japan, and Singapore on June 28, with pre-orders starting June 13."
    * **Correct, direct briefing style:** "Apple has confirmed the international launch dates for the Vision Pro. The headset will debut in China, Japan, and Singapore on June 28, followed by a second launch wave in Australia, Canada, and Europe on July 12. Pre-orders for the first group of countries will open on June 13."

**key_takeaways:** 1-2 sentences that distill the most critical implication or actionable insight for a decision-maker.
* Clearly distinguish between confirmed facts (e.g., "The launch price is confirmed at $3,999.") and speculation or analysis (e.g., "Analysts speculate this staggered launch is to manage supply chain constraints.").

If ADDITIONAL CONTEXT is provided, tailor the summary and takeaways to that perspective.

# Cooler Master's Shark X design, by Inony from Thailand, is an impressive mod and custom case and build that first debuted at the 2019 Cooler Master Case Mod World Series. Just like the Cooler Master custom Sneaker X PC, the Shark X design is being put into production, and pre-orders are now open.
# This is a PC - Cooler Master's Shark X, to be exact. And it costs $7,000. Image credit: Cooler Master.
# Popular Now: Nintendo R&D spending hits record high amid looming Switch 2 launch
# Hardware-wise, it includes the Intel Core i7-14700F processor, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER graphics, 64GB of DDR5 6000 memory, 2TB of PCI Gen4 NVMe SSD storage, and a B760I DDR5 WIFI motherboard. Now, at $6,999.99 USD, it's an expensive rig, and for that price, you'd probably expect a flagship CPU and GPU combo: a 14900K and GeForce RTX 4090.
# However, like with the Sneaker X, a lot of the money here comes down to Cooler Master being able to manufacture several Shark X rigs, where every aspect comes from a custom mod, so there's nothing really off-the-shelf about the chassis. Also, there are limitations in what can be installed due to size restrictions, as it's as much of an art piece as a PC.
# Although the Shark X measures 31.10 x 35.75 x 35.20 inches (790 x 908 x 894 mm), the room left over for the components means you're getting a mini or micro-ITX rig inside a formidable RGB-lit shark. It was a similar situation with the Sneaker X PC, however that ultimately went on sale for half of the asking price of the Shark X.
# Some of the Shark X's cool features as a PC are the fin-to-tail RGB lighting, with the main fin doubling as the Wi-Fi antenna. A custom MasterLiquid 120 Atmos cooler cools the CPU, which you can see on the shark's underside. The components can be swapped out; however, the GPU size is limited to 30.4 x 13.7 x 6.1 cm.
# Pre-orders for Cooler Master's Shark X are now open. Full rigs will be shipped out sometime later this year.

American software will meet Volkswagen hardware in the next-generation version of the iconic hatchback.
Volkswagen and Rivian are joining forces as part of a $5.8 billion dollar deal, one that will see the two companies co-develop architectures and software for future electric vehicles. Now, one VW exec has confirmed where we'll first see the fruits of this joint development between the legacy German automaker and the U.S. startup: the next-generation Volkswagen Golf.
According to reporting from CarSales, development of the electrified hatchback is set to start soon, and Volkswagen is seemingly excited to leverage the engineering prowess and zonal architecture of Illinois's premier electric pickup truck manufacturer. Currently in its eighth generation, the Volkswagen Golf just received a facelift for the 2025 model year, meaning the ninth-generation version of this iconic compact isn't set to arrive until 2029.
Even so, Thomas Schaefer, Volkswagen’s passenger cars chief executive, confirmed earlier this week that the joint partnership between Rivian and Wolfsburg will be used first on the hatchback whose roots date back to the 1970s.
"We decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle. It will happen with Rivian, the joint venture, where we put the new electric electronics architecture together," Schafer said to the media. "But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So, we’ll start with the Golf."
Details remain sparse, but reports from CarSales indicate that the same shared electronic package will eventually make its way into Audi and Porsche products as well. Before that crossover, however, Volkswagen will first test the Rivian-designed software on its Scalable System Platform (SSP). Currently in development, the SSP will replace the MEB platform, which currently holds the ID-series of electric VWs. Notably, CarSales says the MK9 Golf Electric will replace the current ID.3 as VW's compact electric model.
Rivian leadership has previously spoken out against the use of 800- and 900-volt architecture, indicating that this compact hatch may be a lower-voltage build. However, as consumers have voiced complaints about slower charging speeds on current ID-series models, we wouldn't be surprised to see VW push for the more powerful setup.
Volkswagen previously offered the original E-Golf in the U.S. from 2015 through 2020 before culling the electrified Mk7 chassis. It's not immediately clear which markets the Mk9 Golf will be available in, seeing as the North American market has been void of a traditional Golf offering since 2021. We've retained the performance-forward GTI and Golf R, but the reintroduction of the Golf as an electric model for 2029 would be a big deal for the U.S. market.
