# Cooler Master's Shark X design, by Inony from Thailand, is an impressive mod and custom case and build that first debuted at the 2019 Cooler Master Case Mod World Series. Just like the Cooler Master custom Sneaker X PC, the Shark X design is being put into production, and pre-orders are now open.
# This is a PC - Cooler Master's Shark X, to be exact. And it costs $7,000. Image credit: Cooler Master.
# Popular Now: Nintendo R&D spending hits record high amid looming Switch 2 launch
# Hardware-wise, it includes the Intel Core i7-14700F processor, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER graphics, 64GB of DDR5 6000 memory, 2TB of PCI Gen4 NVMe SSD storage, and a B760I DDR5 WIFI motherboard. Now, at $6,999.99 USD, it's an expensive rig, and for that price, you'd probably expect a flagship CPU and GPU combo: a 14900K and GeForce RTX 4090.
# However, like with the Sneaker X, a lot of the money here comes down to Cooler Master being able to manufacture several Shark X rigs, where every aspect comes from a custom mod, so there's nothing really off-the-shelf about the chassis. Also, there are limitations in what can be installed due to size restrictions, as it's as much of an art piece as a PC.
# Although the Shark X measures 31.10 x 35.75 x 35.20 inches (790 x 908 x 894 mm), the room left over for the components means you're getting a mini or micro-ITX rig inside a formidable RGB-lit shark. It was a similar situation with the Sneaker X PC, however that ultimately went on sale for half of the asking price of the Shark X.
# Some of the Shark X's cool features as a PC are the fin-to-tail RGB lighting, with the main fin doubling as the Wi-Fi antenna. A custom MasterLiquid 120 Atmos cooler cools the CPU, which you can see on the shark's underside. The components can be swapped out; however, the GPU size is limited to 30.4 x 13.7 x 6.1 cm.
# Pre-orders for Cooler Master's Shark X are now open. Full rigs will be shipped out sometime later this year.

# American software will meet Volkswagen hardware in the next-generation version of the iconic hatchback.
# Volkswagen and Rivian are joining forces as part of a $5.8 billion dollar deal, one that will see the two companies co-develop architectures and software for future electric vehicles. Now, one VW exec has confirmed where we'll first see the fruits of this joint development between the legacy German automaker and the U.S. startup: the next-generation Volkswagen Golf.
# According to reporting from CarSales, development of the electrified hatchback is set to start soon, and Volkswagen is seemingly excited to leverage the engineering prowess and zonal architecture of Illinois's premier electric pickup truck manufacturer. Currently in its eighth generation, the Volkswagen Golf just received a facelift for the 2025 model year, meaning the ninth-generation version of this iconic compact isn't set to arrive until 2029.
# Even so, Thomas Schaefer, Volkswagen’s passenger cars chief executive, confirmed earlier this week that the joint partnership between Rivian and Wolfsburg will be used first on the hatchback whose roots date back to the 1970s.
# "We decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle. It will happen with Rivian, the joint venture, where we put the new electric electronics architecture together," Schafer said to the media. "But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So, we’ll start with the Golf."
# Details remain sparse, but reports from CarSales indicate that the same shared electronic package will eventually make its way into Audi and Porsche products as well. Before that crossover, however, Volkswagen will first test the Rivian-designed software on its Scalable System Platform (SSP). Currently in development, the SSP will replace the MEB platform, which currently holds the ID-series of electric VWs. Notably, CarSales says the MK9 Golf Electric will replace the current ID.3 as VW's compact electric model.
# Rivian leadership has previously spoken out against the use of 800- and 900-volt architecture, indicating that this compact hatch may be a lower-voltage build. However, as consumers have voiced complaints about slower charging speeds on current ID-series models, we wouldn't be surprised to see VW push for the more powerful setup.
# Volkswagen previously offered the original E-Golf in the U.S. from 2015 through 2020 before culling the electrified Mk7 chassis. It's not immediately clear which markets the Mk9 Golf will be available in, seeing as the North American market has been void of a traditional Golf offering since 2021. We've retained the performance-forward GTI and Golf R, but the reintroduction of the Golf as an electric model for 2029 would be a big deal for the U.S. market.

Today, millions of Americans and their allies turned out across the United States and around the globe to demonstrate their commitment to American democracy and their opposition to a president and an administration apparently bent on replacing that democracy with a dictatorship.
Administration loyalists tried to claim the No Kings protests would be “hate America” rallies of “the pro-Hamas wing and Antifa people.” Texas governor Greg Abbott deployed the Texas National Guard ahead of the No Kings Day protests, warning that “[v]iolence and destruction will never be tolerated in Texas.”
In fact, protesters turned out waving American flags and wearing frog and unicorn and banana costumes and carrying homemade signs that demanded the release of the Epstein files and defended Lady Liberty. They laughed and danced and took selfies and sang. City police departments, including those of New York City, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., said they had made no protest-related arrests.
In Oakland, California, Mother Jones senior editor Michael Mechanic interviewed a man named Justin, asking him if, as a Black man, he had particular concerns about the actions of the Trump administration.
Justin answered: “You know…a lot of times I have a hopeless feeling, but…being out here today just reminds me about the beauty of America and American protests. And, you know, the fact that they tried to…stomp on this, step on this, you know, say it’s non-American, because that’s what I’ve been reading a lot about. No, this is the point of America right here: to be able to have this opportunity to protest…. [This] does not look like Antifa, Hamas, none of this stuff that they’re talking about…. [Y]ou know, this is the beauty of America.”
The No Kings demonstrations ran the gamut from hundreds of thousands of protesters in large, blue cities, to smaller crowds in small towns in Republican-dominated states. Together, they demonstrate that the administration’s claims to popularity are a lie. Such a high turnout means businesses and institutions that thought they must cater to the administration to appeal to a majority of Americans will be forced to recalculate.
And the protests showed that Americans care fervently about democracy.
