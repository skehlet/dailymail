Your task is to analyze news articles and provide concise, relevant summaries highlighting key information.

STEP 1: RELEVANCE DETERMINATION
Determine if the article is 'RELEVANT' or 'NOT RELEVANT' based on these criteria:

RELEVANT content:
- Contains substantive news, analysis, or information about current events, trends, or developments
- Presents original reporting, research findings, or expert perspectives
- Offers meaningful insights or data points that would inform a reader about the world
- Example: "Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 0.5%, citing persistent inflation concerns and strong labor market data."

NOT RELEVANT content:
- Platform announcements (e.g., "This article is hosted on Substack")
- Anything about Substack itself (e.g., "Substack is a platform for independent writers" or "Substack is emerging as a vital platform for independent journalism")
- Subscription solicitations or marketing content
- Audio/podcast introductions that only describe the format without substantive content (e.g., "Listen to this episode where we discuss...")
- Content that merely promotes media hosting features (e.g., "This podcast is now available on Substack")
- Pages that primarily contain audio players with minimal descriptive text
- Content that mainly directs readers to subscribe for full audio access
- Purely administrative text (e.g., "Thanks for listening," "Subscribe to our newsletter")
- Website navigation information, user agreements, or generic platform descriptions
- Example: "Support independent journalism by becoming a paid subscriber. Unlock exclusive content and join our community."

STEP 2: FOR RELEVANT CONTENT ONLY
Summary (3-4 sentences):
- Begin directly with the most important information
- Include key facts, figures, and central claims
- Present complete thoughts without referencing the article itself
- Preserve accuracy without editorializing

Notable Aspects: Write 1-2 complete sentences that highlight unexpected
information, unique perspectives, or important implications from the article.
Present these as flowing prose rather than a list. Focus on elements that add
depth beyond the main summary, such as potential consequences, historical
context, or statistical outliers worth attention.

# Cooler Master's Shark X design, by Inony from Thailand, is an impressive mod and custom case and build that first debuted at the 2019 Cooler Master Case Mod World Series. Just like the Cooler Master custom Sneaker X PC, the Shark X design is being put into production, and pre-orders are now open.
# This is a PC - Cooler Master's Shark X, to be exact. And it costs $7,000. Image credit: Cooler Master.
# Popular Now: Nintendo R&D spending hits record high amid looming Switch 2 launch
# Hardware-wise, it includes the Intel Core i7-14700F processor, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER graphics, 64GB of DDR5 6000 memory, 2TB of PCI Gen4 NVMe SSD storage, and a B760I DDR5 WIFI motherboard. Now, at $6,999.99 USD, it's an expensive rig, and for that price, you'd probably expect a flagship CPU and GPU combo: a 14900K and GeForce RTX 4090.
# However, like with the Sneaker X, a lot of the money here comes down to Cooler Master being able to manufacture several Shark X rigs, where every aspect comes from a custom mod, so there's nothing really off-the-shelf about the chassis. Also, there are limitations in what can be installed due to size restrictions, as it's as much of an art piece as a PC.
# Although the Shark X measures 31.10 x 35.75 x 35.20 inches (790 x 908 x 894 mm), the room left over for the components means you're getting a mini or micro-ITX rig inside a formidable RGB-lit shark. It was a similar situation with the Sneaker X PC, however that ultimately went on sale for half of the asking price of the Shark X.
# Some of the Shark X's cool features as a PC are the fin-to-tail RGB lighting, with the main fin doubling as the Wi-Fi antenna. A custom MasterLiquid 120 Atmos cooler cools the CPU, which you can see on the shark's underside. The components can be swapped out; however, the GPU size is limited to 30.4 x 13.7 x 6.1 cm.
# Pre-orders for Cooler Master's Shark X are now open. Full rigs will be shipped out sometime later this year.

American software will meet Volkswagen hardware in the next-generation version of the iconic hatchback.
Volkswagen and Rivian are joining forces as part of a $5.8 billion dollar deal, one that will see the two companies co-develop architectures and software for future electric vehicles. Now, one VW exec has confirmed where we'll first see the fruits of this joint development between the legacy German automaker and the U.S. startup: the next-generation Volkswagen Golf.
According to reporting from CarSales, development of the electrified hatchback is set to start soon, and Volkswagen is seemingly excited to leverage the engineering prowess and zonal architecture of Illinois's premier electric pickup truck manufacturer. Currently in its eighth generation, the Volkswagen Golf just received a facelift for the 2025 model year, meaning the ninth-generation version of this iconic compact isn't set to arrive until 2029.
Even so, Thomas Schaefer, Volkswagen’s passenger cars chief executive, confirmed earlier this week that the joint partnership between Rivian and Wolfsburg will be used first on the hatchback whose roots date back to the 1970s.
"We decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle. It will happen with Rivian, the joint venture, where we put the new electric electronics architecture together," Schafer said to the media. "But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So, we’ll start with the Golf."
Details remain sparse, but reports from CarSales indicate that the same shared electronic package will eventually make its way into Audi and Porsche products as well. Before that crossover, however, Volkswagen will first test the Rivian-designed software on its Scalable System Platform (SSP). Currently in development, the SSP will replace the MEB platform, which currently holds the ID-series of electric VWs. Notably, CarSales says the MK9 Golf Electric will replace the current ID.3 as VW's compact electric model.
Rivian leadership has previously spoken out against the use of 800- and 900-volt architecture, indicating that this compact hatch may be a lower-voltage build. However, as consumers have voiced complaints about slower charging speeds on current ID-series models, we wouldn't be surprised to see VW push for the more powerful setup.
Volkswagen previously offered the original E-Golf in the U.S. from 2015 through 2020 before culling the electrified Mk7 chassis. It's not immediately clear which markets the Mk9 Golf will be available in, seeing as the North American market has been void of a traditional Golf offering since 2021. We've retained the performance-forward GTI and Golf R, but the reintroduction of the Golf as an electric model for 2029 would be a big deal for the U.S. market.
